-- Assuming your table structure is like this
CREATE TABLE verses (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    text TEXT,
    views_count INT
);

-- Inserting sample data
INSERT INTO verses (id, text, views_count) VALUES
(1, 'John 3:16', 100),
(2, 'Psalm 23:1', 90),
-- ... (insert more verses with their views_count)

-- Query to get the top 100 verses based on views_count
SELECT id, text, views_count
FROM verses
ORDER BY views_count DESC
LIMIT 100;


-- This SQL query selects the top 100 verses from the verses table based on the views_count column in descending order. You may need to adjust the column names and structure based on your actual database schema.

-- Please replace id, text, and views_count with the actual column names you have in your database. Also, ensure that the views_count field or any other relevant metric is appropriately updated based on user interactions on your website.

-- This is a basic example, and in a real-world scenario, you might have more complex requirements and considerations for what makes a verse "top" (e.g., considering time, user interactions, etc.).
